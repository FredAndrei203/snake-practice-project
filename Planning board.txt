Create snake
How?
Snake can move and eat apples.
Snake grow when eating apple.
Wins when whole screen is covered with snek.

How does snake move?
Snake can move in four cardinal directions.
Snake loops around the stage when going to the edges.
It moves discretely, not continuously. So every n seconds.

How does snake eat apple?
Apple is an Area2D. When it detects the snake head, it is considered eaten.
Snake also detects the apple and counts it as eaten.
The apple then dissapears.

How does the apple appear?
It appears anywhere that is not occupied by the snake.

One more thing.
The stage is a grid of A by B units so movement and spawning is consistent.

How does the body follow the snake?
Each part of the snake is its own object.
The snake head, and many snake segments.
The snake segments just follow the movement of the precedding segment.

How does the snake spawn additional body segments?
The new body segments always spawn just right behind the snake head.
That means the other body segments will pause for one time for that to happen.

How to detect if whole screen has snek all over?
We create object called grid.
That is essentially the parts of the playing field.
The stage will detect if all grid has snake.

How does snake lose?
If the grid it is about to move on has a body segment, game over.

How exactly is movement done?
So, the snake moves discretely, at an interval.
At the end of the interval, the snake looks what is the last arrow key held.
That is where it will move.
If not arrow key is held, it will go to the same direction as previously.
